This Python script uses Selenium and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to scrape the price of a product from Amazon. It interacts with Amazon's product page, attempts to extract the price, and handles cases where CAPTCHA is displayed by using OCR to read CAPTCHA text 

The goal of this project is to demonstrate web scraping, price extraction, and OCR usage, while also handling CAPTCHA verification when it's triggered.
