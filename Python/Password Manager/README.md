This Python project is a password manager built using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to securely store and manage website credentials with the following features:

Generate Password: Automatically generates a strong, random password (10 characters long) and copies it to the clipboard for easy use.
Save Password: Users can input their website, email/username, and password, which will be saved to a local JSON file. Passwords are only saved after confirmation.
Find Password: Users can search for saved credentials by entering the website name. If the credentials are found, they will be displayed in a popup message.
JSON File Storage: All passwords are stored in a data.json file, and the program can load and update data as needed.
The project also ensures that users are prompted if any fields are left empty or if data for a specific website is not found.
