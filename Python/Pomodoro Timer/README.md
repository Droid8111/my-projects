This Python code implements a Pomodoro timer using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI).

The code automates the Pomodoro technique, where work sessions of a set duration are alternated with short breaks. The user can start and reset the timer, and the program will automatically manage the countdown based on the following intervals:

Work: 1 minute (can be adjusted in the constants)
Short Break: 2 minutes (can be adjusted)
Long Break: 3 minutes (can be adjusted)
The program tracks work sessions and displays checkmarks to indicate how many work sessions have been completed. The user interface is simple, with a visual timer and buttons to start and reset the timer.

Tested for stability during continuous use without errors
