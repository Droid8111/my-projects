This python code includes the turtle library, i try to learn how to use classes.
In this code I can play as a snake trying to eat the apple that randomly appears on the map, i try to navigate to the apple without hitting the wall or eating myself.
I have a highscore system where the highscore value is saved in a different file and will be used next time the code is run.
