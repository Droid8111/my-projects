This script is designed to automate interactions with a Sudoku puzzle-solving app on an Android device. It uses ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to interact with the device, OpenCV for image processing, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) with Tesseract to read Sudoku puzzle grids from screenshots.

Key Features:
Take Screenshot using ADB: The script can capture a screenshot of the device's screen and process it.
Image Preprocessing for OCR: Uses OpenCV to preprocess the image by applying adaptive thresholding, which enhances the quality of the image for OCR.
Extract Sudoku Grid with OCR: The OCR reads the extracted cells from the image and converts them into a Sudoku grid.
Sudoku Solver: It solves the extracted Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.
Automated Clicking: It simulates taps on the screen of the Android device to fill the solved grid in the Sudoku app.
Gift Function: It automates a specific sequence of clicks (used in the context of the app).
Keyboard Commands:
Press s to start solving the puzzle.
Press g to run the gift function.
Press l to stop the script.
How It Works:
Capture Image:

The screenshot() function uses ADB to take a screenshot of the Android device's screen.
It then pulls the image from the device to the local machine.
Image Preprocessing:

The preprocess_image() function converts the image to grayscale and applies histogram equalization to improve the contrast.
Adaptive thresholding is applied to enhance the image quality further for OCR.
OCR Grid Extraction:

The extract_grid_from_image() function processes each cell of the Sudoku grid by performing OCR. It resizes the cell images and uses Tesseract to extract the number or 0 if the cell is empty.
Sudoku Solver:

The Sudoku() function recursively solves the puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.
Once the puzzle is solved, it prints the solution.
Automated Interactions:

The click_cells() function simulates tapping at specific coordinates on the Android screen to input the solved Sudoku values.
Gift Function:

The gift() function simulates a series of clicks on the screen, which appears to be part of an app's functionality
