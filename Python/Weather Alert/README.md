This Python script fetches weather forecast data for a given location using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app provides a forecast for the next few hours and suggests whether you should bring an umbrella based on the weather conditions.

Features:
Weather Forecast: Retrieves the weather forecast for the upcoming hours from OpenWeatherMap.
Data Display: Displays the date, temperature (in Kelvin), weather description, and weather condition ID.
Umbrella Suggestion: If the forecast indicates rain or bad weather (based on weather condition ID), the app will prompt you to bring an umbrella.
How It Works:
API Request: The app sends a request to OpenWeatherMap API with the latitude and longitude of a location.
Weather Data Extraction: It processes the API response and extracts relevant weather data, such as temperature, weather description, and the weather condition ID.
Umbrella Advice: Based on the weather condition ID, the app suggests whether you should bring an umbrella if rain is expected
